## Testing the api folder

Generally we will not need to test the files in this folder as they are straight forward.

Our Url files which store our url addresses will not need to be tested at all as they are files just saving data

Our Index files can be tested to make sure they run correctly, however as axios is a trusted library this may be overkill

Some methods in index files do hold some extra logic in that case they should be tested
